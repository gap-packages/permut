# PERMUT: a GAP4 package to deal with permutability

The package `permut' contains some functions to deal with
permutability in finite groups.

## Installation 
To install this package, just decompress the file permut-1.04.tar.bz2
in a directory in the pkg hierarchy of the GAP installation. It
requires the package `format' to be previously installed. Use then
  LoadPackage("permut");
to load it.
GAP 4.7.4 or later is required.
Inside GAP, help can be obtained by using
  `?permut:'

The tst/ directory contains the file permut.tst which can be used to
test the installation. In the `doc/' directory, the file `manual.pdf'
contains the manual in PDF format. The HTML version starting page is
the file `chap0.html' of the `doc/' directory.
