v1.01: 
- Changed the path of PackageInfo.g, as suggested by Alexander Konovalov
- Corected two typos in the manual.
  

v1.00: The package has been accepted by the GAP Council. Changes proposed by Alice Niemeyer and the anonymous referee:
- Added in AllGeneratorsCyclicPGroup a test for the arguments to be of the correct type.
- Minor changes to the documentation



v0.04: Changes proposed by Alice Niemeyer and the anonymous referee:
- Documentation written in GAPDoc. Minor modifications in the documentation.
- Changed names of the old `Why' functions:
  WhyAreNotMutuallyFPermutableSubgroups -> OnePairShowingNotMutuallyFPermutableSubgroups
  WhyAreNotMutuallyPermutableSubgroups -> OnePairShowingNotMutuallyPermutableSubgroups
  WhyAreNotTotallyFPermutableSubgroups -> OnePairShowingNotTotallyFPermutableSubgroups
  WhyAreNotTotallyPermutableSubgroups ->OnePairShowingNotTotallyPermutableSubgroups
  WhyIsNotConjugatePermutable -> OneConjugateSubgroupNotPermutingWith
  WhyIsNotCPTGroup -> OneSubnormalNonConjugatePermutableSubgroup
  WhyIsNotFPermutable -> OneFSubgroupNotPermutingWith
  WhyIsNotPermutable -> OneSubgroupNotPermutingWith
  WhyIsNotPSNTGroup -> OneSubnormalNonSNPermutableSubgroup
  WhyIsNotPSTGroup -> OneSubnormalNonSPermutableSubgroup
  WhyIsNotPTGroup -> OneSubnormalNonPermutableSubgroup
  WhyIsNotSNPermutable -> OneSystemNormaliserNotPermutingWith
  WhyIsNotSPermutable -> OneSylowSubgroupNotPermutingWith
  WhyIsNotTGroup -> OneSubnormalNonNormalSubgroup
  WhyIsNotWeaklyNormal -> OneElementShowingNotWeaklyNormal
  WhyIsNotWeaklyPermutable -> OneElementShowingNotWeaklyPermutable
  WhyIsNotWeaklySPermutable -> OneElementShowingNotWeaklySPermutable
  WhyIsNotWithSSubpermutizerCondition -> OneSubgroupInWhichSubnormalNotSPermutable
  WhyIsNotWithSubnormalizerCondition -> OneSubgroupInWhichSubnormalNotNormal
  WhyIsNotWithSubpermutizerCondition -> OneSubgroupInWhichSubnormalNotPermutable
- Modified functions about totally and mutually permutable products to
  avoid use of AllCyclicSubgroups. We use Zuppos instead. The function AllCyclicSubgroups has been deleted.
- Modified Permutizer function to detect permutable subgroups and to
use an enumerator instead of all cyclic subgroups.
- Added a probabilistic test to detect lack of permutability before
applying deterministic test in IsPermutable and IsIwasawaSylow.
- Modified the type of arguments of OneFSubgroupNotPermutingWith and
IsFPermutable, now the third argument is a list of subgroups of the
whole group.
- Modified the arguments of AreMutuallyFPermutableSubgroups,
AreTotallyFPermutableSubgroups, OnePairSwhowingNotMutuallyPermutable
and OnePairSwhowingNotMutuallyPermutable to include lists of subgroups of U and
V, respectively. This allows a greater generality.
- Deleted functions IsPERMUTPSolvable and IsPERMUTPNilpotent since there
are methods for non-soluble groups available in GAP 4.7.2. These
functions have been replaced by IsPSolvable and IsPNilpotent in the
code. GAP 4.7.2 is required now.


v0.03: Deleted InstallFactorMaintenance and InstallSubsetMaintenance
  statements due to an error in the assignment of IsPSTGroup to
  quotient groups.


v0.02: changes proposed by Leonhard Soicher before refereeing and others:
- Moved files *.g to lib directory.
- Created directory htm to include html files.
- Changed PackageInfo.g to be correctly validated.
- Rearranged documentation (only chapters).
- Added a test.
- Moved IsSylowTowerGroup to psoluble.g[di].
- Applied Transatlantic.


v0.01: initial version
